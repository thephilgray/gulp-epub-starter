<h2>a new kind of folk culture</h2>
<p>So the idea here is to enable the creative impulses that the
technology turns loose, and get the law out of the way. The work of
Creative Commons is really about laying the infrastructure and
ground work for this new type of culture.</p>

<p>A new kind of Folk Culture. Somebody from Delhi, somebody from
New York, somebody from Singapore, can feel comfortable using photo
that was created and given away by somebody in The United States,
or in China, or wherever that the licenses have been extended to.
With their identity being preserved. Which means that people can
actually create new kinds of things, come together and build
things.</p>
